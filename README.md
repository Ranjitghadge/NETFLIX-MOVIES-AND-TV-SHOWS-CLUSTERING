## ðŸ“– Introduction

Netflix, the worldâ€™s largest on-demand internet streaming media and online DVD movie rental service provider, was founded on August 29, 1997, in Los Gatos, California by Marc and Reed. With 69 million members in over 60 countries enjoying more than 100 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, Netflix has become the worldâ€™s leading internet entertainment service, offering a wide variety of genres and languages in its TV series, documentaries, and feature films. This project aims to analyze the content released on the Netflix platform and identify similar groups of people.

## ðŸ“– Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to find similarities within groups of people in order to build a movie recommendation system for users. By analyzing a dataset from the Netflix database, we will explore the common characteristics that people share when it comes to movies. The endless scrolling and decision-making process of selecting what to watch often result in users spending more time deciding than actually watching a movie. This project aims to address this issue by providing tailored recommendations to enhance the user experience.

## ðŸ“– Data Summary

The dataset used in this project consists of TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The data was collected from Fixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. According to a 2018 report by Fixable, the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010, while the number of movies has decreased by over 2,000 titles. Exploring this dataset can provide valuable insights, and integrating it with external datasets such as IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes can lead to even more interesting findings. The dataset includes the following fields:

- `show_id`: Unique ID for every movie/TV show
- `type`: Identifier - Movie or TV Show
- `title`: Title of the movie/TV show
- `director`: Director of the movie
- `cast`: Actors involved in the movie/show
- `country`: Country where the movie/show was produced
- `date_added`: Date it was added on Netflix
- `release_year`: Actual release year of the movie/show
- `rating`: TV rating of the movie/show
- `duration`: Total duration in minutes or number of seasons
- `listed_in`: Genres
- `description`: The summary description

## ðŸ“– Exploring Solutions

To address the challenge of users spending excessive time deciding what to watch, several potential solutions were identified:

1. Improve rating system: Utilize a star rating system instead of a thumbs-up/thumbs-down system to provide more guidance in decision making.
2. Separate recently watched: Create a separate page for movies and TV shows that have already been viewed, reducing the need for users to scroll through content they have already seen.
3. Randomize a Movie: Offer a random selection feature based on users' viewing history for times when they are unsure of what to choose.
4. Show popular/trending films: Introduce a category dedicated to showcasing trending content to help users discover popular titles.
5. Connect with Friends: Enable users to connect with friends and receive recommendations, as studies have shown that users often watch shows and movies based on friend recommendations.

## ðŸ“– Conclusion

In conclusion, tailored recommendations can be made based on information about movies and TV shows. Additionally, similar models can be developed to provide valuable recommendations to consumers in other domains. This will result in improved movie and TV show selection times, increased satisfaction with the content being consumed, greater user engagement, and increased trust in Netflix recommendations.
